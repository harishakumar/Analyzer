# Analyzer
This is an image processing library that implements algorithms and utilities for better visualisation of the image being analysed.


In our data-rich world, images represent a significant subset of all measurements made.
Exploring these rich data sources requires sophisticated software tools that should be easy to use, free of charge and restrictions, and able to address all the challenges posed by such a diverse field of analysis.
